============
I've had a few people ask for help learning C++, so this is a collection of
programming assignments to help learn and improve skills with C++.


Requirements
------------
- Write tests for everything.  If you don't know how to use gtest_, this is a
  good excuse to learn.
- Make the tests high quality.  Test boundary conditions, throw weird things
  at your code, and try to make it break.  If you handle the extreme cases,
  the normal cases are easy.
- Run tests through as many quality checks as possible.  Clang sanitizers,
  valgrind, multiple compilers, and anything else you can think of are great.
  If you're not familiar with these tools, think of this is another learning
  experience.
- Have fun.  It sucks when you're adding template support and you get pages of
  errors from gcc, but wen you get the code working it's magic.  Keep at it,
  even if you need to take a break and grab a sandwich before coming back.
